# student-record-management-system
A simple and efficient CLI-based CRUD application developed in Java to manage student records.
This project demonstrates the use of Object-Oriented Programming, ArrayList, and menu-driven console interaction, making it ideal for learning real-world data management.
## Features

- Add Student – Insert new student records
- View Students – Display all stored records
- Update Student – Modify existing student details
- Delete Student – Remove a record by ID
 ## How It Works
 
1. At program start, a menu is displayed.
2. User selects an option (1–4).
